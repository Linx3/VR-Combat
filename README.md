# VR-Combat
VR Combat was built in Unity Engine using the Google VR Reticle Pointer and Gaze Input. 
The goal of the game is for the player to knock out as many opponents as possible using missiles projectiles. 
The player uses the Pointer and the Gaze Input to navigate around the map and launch projectiles through Euler angles. 
The enemies’ algorithms were also constructed to track and follow the player’s live location. 
The game can be built on Android devices and VR headsets.
